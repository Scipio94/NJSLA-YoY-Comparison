# NJSLA-YoY-Comparison
Comparison of state test results from the previous school year to track progress in proficiency performance in ELA as a network, campus, and grade level. 

## Objective

This summary analysis will analyze the year over year (YoY) proficiency performance on the New Jersey Student Learning Assessments (NJSLA) for the 2022 and 2023 school years (SY) in ELA at Foundation Academies. The analysis will be guided by the following questions:

1. What was the overall YoY proficiency performance in ELA and MATH ?
2. What was the YoY proficiency performance in ELA and MATH at each campus?
3. What was the YoY proficiency performance in ELA and MATH in each grade level?


## Analysis

1. What was the overall YoY proficiency performance in ELA and MATH ?
